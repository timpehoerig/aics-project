## Overview

### Abstract

The current implementation of PyTTR has two major draw backs: First, it is based on Python3.4 and thus, cannot utilize the modern python features. Second, objects and types in PyTTR differ from objects and types in python. However, as PyTTR is a designed as a library, writing simple programs in PyTTR require verbose syntax in python's OOP style. In this paper different approaches on solving these drawbacks are discussed and a solution in form of a PyTTR-Programming languages is presented.
